# JSDoc 4 Plugin for ReactJS Tags

JSDoc 4 has got a lot of tags which are used to describe the various elements of the JavaScript language. But **ReactJS** has included a lot of new concepts which are not available in basic JavaScript. For example, a *Component* is either a JavaScript *Function* or a *Class*. But in the context of React development, it is far more readable to call that a **Component** instead of **Function** or **Class**.

This is what this plugin introduces. Tags which can be used to specifically document the various conceptual elements included by ReactJS Framework.
